- Diagrams are in the Diagrams folder under Homework2 (pdfs & UXF, for UMLet)
- 7 of the test cases are written by Dr. Clyde (all of the ones with the StreamStocksMessage and TickerMessage)
- I am using all of Clydes classes that were shared, w/ some modifications (Communicator, StockPortfolio, Stock, Subject, etc.)
- The Graphs themselves are not complete, but they do show open/close prices.
- For some reason GGL does not work as an option for monitoring.
- The simulator is still sending messages even when the program exits (even after the quick fix Dr. Clyde showed me)
- When loading a portfolio the file must exist in the current working directory (Homework2/bin/Debug) or the loading won't work.
- When saving a portfolio the file is saved to the current working directory (Homework2/bin/Debug).
- For some reason loading a portfolio adds multiple StockPriceControls to the panel so:
	- you have to press 'X' multiple times to remove the stock.
	- pressing 'X' once will remove them from the portfolio, so saving again won't save anything if 'X' was pressed twice on all of them.
