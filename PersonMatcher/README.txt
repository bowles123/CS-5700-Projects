The main function to run the program resides in src\main\java\com\USU\OOP\PersonMatcherDriver.java.
    - To be able to run it you need to include the org.json jar as a dependency and a class library to the project. (jar included in this zip)

The test are all in the src\test\java\com\USU\OOP\ folder.
    - To be able to run the test you need to include two jars, both of which are included in this zip.
        1. The junit.jar file needs to be included as a dependency to the project.
        2. the testng.jar file needs to be included as a dependency and as a class library to the project.

All of the diagrams are included within the zip inside the "Diagrams" folder.

All of the needed jars, talked about above, are included within the zip inside the "Dependencies" folder.

The text output files appear in the "TextOutput" folder after the program has run successfully.

The way I implemented my XMLImporterExporter it causes the program to crash if a particular element doesn't exist in the xml.
In order to get around this I filled in those xml elements and populated them with "null".

Lastly I have a class diagram for my system as a whole and I have those same diagrams separated into about 4 different diagrams.
